  This website is made using Jekyll and is hosted by
  <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>,
  the code is available at
  <a href="https://github.com/RobBrenn/robbrenn.github.io">robbrenn.github.io</a>

  Rarebit refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_rarebit">Welsh rarebit</a>,
  but I also like the idea of having a few bytes of rare bits.

  Special thanks to <a href="http://longqian.me">Long Qian</a> for their
  <a href="http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/">Jekyll Tags</a>
  guide that helped me realise Github only allows some plugins, and not the useful
  jekyll-tagging plugin, and provided example code for adding tags to posts.
