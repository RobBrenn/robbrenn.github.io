<p>This door in Bristol is, I believe attached to a Vicarage. The house has a blue plaque saying that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_More">Hannah More</a> was born there in 1745, later in life she campaigned against the slave trade. She is featured on the Â£10 Bristol Pound notes. </p> 
<p>The house had a lovely garden with lots of flowers blooming at the time. </p>
<p>I especially liked the little touch of the horseshoe, which in Christian superstition is supposed to ward off the Devil.</p>
