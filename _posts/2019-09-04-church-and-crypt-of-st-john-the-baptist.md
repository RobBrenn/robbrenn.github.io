Double door special!

<p>
The first door is to St John the Baptistes church,
while the second rather small door takes you down into the crypt! ⚰️
</p>
<p>
The church is built into the city walls,
so is a rather odd shape, which gives it a lovely atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
The church is open daily for free tours by volunteers, and the day I took these
pictures I had a little bonus tour! I was shown up to have a look at the church
organ (from 1884), as well as look into the bell tower where I got to learn a bit
of history of the bells, and a demonstration of the bells in action.
</p>
<p>
I even got to have a go at ringing a bell! Which was not as easy as it looks!
